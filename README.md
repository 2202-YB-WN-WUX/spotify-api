# Spotify Api
Simple app which gets recent singles/albums using AJAX GET.

- *Important*: you will need to put your own API key into line 4 below in script.js:
```
const token = "your-token-goes-here";
```

- Replace "your-token-goes-here" with your own token from http://developer.spotify.com/console/get-new-releases/
- You'll need to generate a new token every hour as they expire
